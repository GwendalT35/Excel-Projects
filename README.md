How it works

There are 6 buttons to control the database on the Dashboard, each of them has a different use, these are as such :

- Import/Add : It requires the user to state a Lego set ID that can easily be found on the box, the instructions or the Lego Website
  aswell as the amount of copies of the set the user owns and want to add to the Database.
- Create : It requires the user to state a Lego set ID that can easily be found on the box, the instructions or the Lego Website,
  this macro will then tell the user how many parts he misses in order to create the set, the user will then be asked if he wants to be redirected to Brickset to see
  this set's instructions.
- Instructions : It requires the user to state a Lego set ID that can easily be found on the box, the instructions or the Lego Website,
  he will then be redirected to Brickset to see this set's instructions.
- Delete : It requires the user to state a Lego set Name, if the user does not know the Name of the set in english he can check the set he owns from 
  the sheet named My_Sets, the macro will then asks the User how many copies of this set does he want deleted. It will then proceeds to ask the user if he wants
  the set out of the Database.
- Reset : Plain and simple, it's a reset button, if you have imported sets, it will ask if you are sure about deleting them from the database.
- Feedback/Bug : A Feedback/ Bug report macro that will redirect the user to this project's Github.
